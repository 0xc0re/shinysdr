<h1><a href="./">ShinySDR Manual</a>: Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>How can I make ShinySDR more CPU-efficient?</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
        Run the command <kbd>volk_profile</kbd>.
        It will take several minutes to run benchmarks and write a configuration file telling GNU Radio how to most efficiently execute DSP operations on your CPU.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In <a href="configuration">your ShinySDR <code>config.py</code></a>, configure your devices for the lowest sample rate that they support (and that provides enough bandwidth for your use).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In <a href="configuration">your ShinySDR <code>config.py</code></a>, add <code>config.features.disable('stereo')</code> to use mono audio.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt>The log is full of “<code>OOOOOOOOOOO...</code>”.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>It is a common for the drivers of receiver hardware to print “<code>O</code>” whenever data was received from the hardware and not accepted by the software. This can have several causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Normally: When ShinySDR is deliberately paused (no clients connected, or neither receivers nor spectrum display active).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there's nothing to be done about this unless those drivers were to be modified (and it does not indicate a problem).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Abnormally: When a bug has caused signal processing to lock up.</p>
        <p>In this case, you usually must restart the server.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is too much work for the CPU.</p>
        <p>See the section on efficiency.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>WebSocket connection failed</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>If you are attempting to use Firefox: Firefox's WebSocket client implementation is known to be incompatible with the WebSocket server implementation ShinySDR uses. This might be fixed in the future by switching to a different WebSocket server library.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ShinySDR uses two TCP ports. If you have a firewall or NAT, make sure that both ports specified in the config file are allowed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>exceptions.RuntimeError: list contains invalid format!</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>You have installed two different versions of GNU Radio, such that the Python library version that was found is not the same as the C++ library version. Uninstall the one you don't want, or ensure your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable points to the right place.</p>
  </dd>
