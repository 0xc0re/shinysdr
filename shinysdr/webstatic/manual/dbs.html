<h1><a href="./">ShinySDR Manual</a>: Frequency Databases</h1>

<p>TODO: Explain the purpose of frequency databases.

<h2>Data Format</h2>

<p>The import/export format for frequency databases is an extended version of <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/">CHIRP</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> format.
  (Why that? Because it was the first documented and straightforward existing data format I found.)
  <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/MemoryEditorColumns">Here is CHIRP's documentation of the column formats.</a>
  Not all columns are currently used by ShinySDR; in particular, those related to transmitter settings are not.</p>

<p>The minimum columns required for a useful database are <code>Frequency</code> (in megahertz) and <code>Name</code>; for example,

<blockquote><pre>Frequency,Name
10,WWV</pre></blockquote>

<p>The extensions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>The <code>Frequency</code> column may contain two frequencies separated by a hyphen “-”.
    In this case, the record defines a <em>band</em> instead of a channel.
    The lower frequency should always be specified first.
    (TODO: Make sure code either rejects or fixes this.)</p></li>
  <li><p>Two additional columns <code>Latitude</code> and <code>Longitude</code> can be used to specify the geographic location of a specific station. Each value, if not blank, should be a decimal number of degrees (negative values are south or west) and, if you want to be exact, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS 84</a> coordinate system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TODO: Write up our own documentation of all of the columns, to be fully precise and in case CHIRP makes changes to their version.</p>
