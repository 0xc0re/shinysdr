<h1><a href="./">ShinySDR Manual</a>: Frequency Databases</h1>

<p>Frequency databases are reference information for navigating the radio spectrum; each database record may describe a band, channel, or station. They are available in a list, overlaid on the spectrum display, and (when geographic information is available) overlaid on the map.</p>

<h2>Using databases</h2>

<p>[TODO: Explain the UI here]</p>

<h2>Data format</h2>

<p>The file format for frequency databases is a relative of <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/">CHIRP</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>-based database format; files created by/for CHIRP can be used in ShinySDR.
  (Why? Because it was the first documented and straightforward existing data format I found.)
  <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/MemoryEditorColumns">Here is CHIRP's documentation of the column formats.</a>
  Not all columns are currently used by ShinySDR; in particular, those related to transmitter settings are not.</p>

<p>The minimum columns required for a useful database are <code>Frequency</code> (in megahertz) and <code>Name</code>, and <code>Mode</code> is usually also wanted; for example, a listing of the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/wwv.cfm">WWV time station</a>'s transmitters might look like this:

<blockquote><pre>Mode,Frequency,Name
AM,2.5,WWV
AM,5,WWV
AM,10,WWV
AM,15,WWV
AM,20,WWV</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Reference</h3>

<p>Each database file must be a CSV file with the first row being column names. The character encoding must be UTF-8 (or ASCII).</p>

<p>The following columns are understood by ShinySDR. (<strong>Caution:</strong> for <em>writable</em> databases, other columns present in the original file will be lost.)</p>

<dl>
  
  <dt><code>Frequency</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Required.
      Specifies the frequency the record is describing, in megahertz (MHz).
    <p>May be either a single decimal number for <em>channel</em> or <em>station</em> records, or two decimal numbers separated by an ASCII hyphen (<code>-</code>), smaller followed by larger, for <em>band</em> records.
    <p>[TODO: Either reject or fix larger followed by smaller.]</p>
    <p>(Specifying a band is a ShinySDR-specific format extension.)</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>Name</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optional (but necessary in practice). Name of this record. In most places where database records are shown, this is the only text that will be shown. Should be a single line.</p></dd>
  
  <dt><code>Mode</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Optional.
      The mode of the signal(s) transmitted on the frequency or within the band; used to automatically select the correct demodulator.</p>
  
    <p>The currently recognized codes are: AM, NFM, WFM, USB, LSB, CW, APRS, MODE-S, VOR. This list is probably out of date. [TODO: Have a place where the actual plugin supported list is available for reference.]</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>Latitude</code> and <code>Longitude</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Optional.
      If both are not blank, specifies the geographic location of the <em>station</em> described by this record.
      If specified, these coordinates are used to display locations on the map.
      A planned but not yet implemented feature is to use them to operate attached antenna rotators.</p>
    
    <p>Coordinates must be a decimal number of degrees north and east in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS 84</a> coordinate system.</p>

    <p>(These columns are a ShinySDR-specific format extension.)</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><code>Comment</code></dt>
  <dd><p>Optional.
    Any text you wish to enter.
    Displayed only in the database editor/details view.
    May be multiple lines (quoted in the CSV file).</p></dd>
  
</dl>
